**rust-code-analysis** is a Rust library to analyze and extract information
from source codes written in many different programming languages.
It is based on a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library
called
<a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/" target="_blank">Tree Sitter</a>.


In addition, we provide a command line tool called **rust-code-analysis-cli**
to interact with the API of the library in an easy way.

This tool can be used to:

- Call **rust-code-analysis** API
- Print nodes and metrics information
- Export metrics in different formats
