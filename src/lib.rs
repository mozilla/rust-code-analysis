//! rust-code-analysis is a library to analyze and extract information
//! from source codes written in many different programming languages.
//!
//! You can find the source code of this software on
//! <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust-code-analysis/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
//! while issues and feature requests can be posted on the respective
//! <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust-code-analysis/issues/" target="_blank">GitHub Issue Tracker</a>.
//!
//! ## Supported Languages
//!
//! - C++
//! - C#
//! - CSS
//! - Go
//! - HTML
//! - Java
//! - JavaScript
//! - The JavaScript used in Firefox internal
//! - Python
//! - Rust
//! - Typescript
//!
//! ## Supported Metrics
//!
//! - CC: it calculates the code complexity examining the
//!   control flow of a program.
//! - SLOC: it counts the number of lines in a source file.
//! - PLOC: it counts the number of physical lines (instructions)
//!   contained in a source file.
//! - LLOC: it counts the number of logical lines (statements)
//!   contained in a source file.
//! - CLOC: it counts the number of comments in a source file.
//! - BLANK: it counts the number of blank lines in a source file.
//! - HALSTEAD: it is a suite that provides a series of information,
//!   such as the effort required to maintain the analyzed code,
//!   the size in bits to store the program, the difficulty to understand
//!   the code, an estimate of the number of bugs present in the codebase,
//!   and an estimate of the time needed to implement the software.
//! - MI: it is a suite that allows to evaluate the maintainability
//!   of a software.
//! - NOM: it counts the number of functions and closures
//!   in a file/trait/class.
//! - NEXITS: it counts the number of possible exit points
//!   from a method/function.
//! - NARGS: it counts the number of arguments of a function/method.
